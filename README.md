# Facebook Crawler

This project is a web crawler built with Python that extracts venue data (wedding reception venues) from a website using asynchronous programming with Crawl4AI. It utilizes a language model-based extraction strategy and saves the collected data to a CSV file.

## Features

- Asynchronous web crawling using [Crawl4AI](https://pypi.org/project/Crawl4AI/)
- Data extraction powered by a language model (LLM)
- CSV export of extracted venue information


## Installation

1. **Create and Activate a Conda Environment**

   ```bash
   conda create -n facebook-groups-crawler python=3.12 -y
   conda activate facebook-groups-crawler
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Install Playwrite**
   playwright install

3. **Set Up Your Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with content similar to:

   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

   *(Note: The `.env` file is in your .gitignore, so it wonâ€™t be pushed to version control.)*

## Usage

To start the crawler, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will crawl the specified website, extract data page by page, and save the complete venues to a `complete_venues.csv` file in the project directory. Additionally, usage statistics for the LLM strategy will be displayed after crawling.

## Configuration

The `config.py` file contains key constants used throughout the project:

- **BASE_URL**: The URL of the website from which to extract venue data.
- **CSS_SELECTOR**: CSS selector string used to target venue content.
- **REQUIRED_KEYS**: List of required fields to consider a venue complete.

You can modify these values as needed.

## Additional Notes

- **Logging:** The project currently uses print statements for status messages. For production or further development, consider integrating Pythonâ€™s built-in `logging` module.
- **Improvements:** The code is structured in multiple modules to maintain separation of concerns, making it easier for beginners to follow and extend the functionality.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that the package versions specified in `requirements.txt` are installed to avoid compatibility issues.
